# 🥋 Mudo Club Taekwondo - Powered by Next Generation

Welcome to the official repository of **Mudo Club Taekwondo**, a project proudly crafted by **Next Generation**, my web agency. 🌐  

This repository showcases the work done for **Mudo Club Taekwondo**, the leading taekwondo club in Argenteuil. The project involved creating a **modern and professional showcase website** to elevate the club’s online presence. The previous platform was an outdated and poorly maintained blog, and this transformation positions the club as a professional organization, while providing tools to attract more members. The code is stored in a private repository, but this README outlines the project’s features and technologies.
